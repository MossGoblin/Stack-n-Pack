= BUGS =

-- groupList not maintained properly!! -- should not re-check groups if crate picked up from service lane

= REFACTORING =

-- start objectification -- sooner or later??
	-- move the crates into a class FIRST as soon as possible
-- use string for the order indices, instead of int
-- try out the special pick-up command scheme
-- simplify vacancy check by using the crateGrid
-- hash groups on each change ??

= = =

-- when splitting group - assume the identity of teh largest successor
-- rework the initial distribution of rarityes - crate00 is always most common, crate06 is always most rate, the rest are random
