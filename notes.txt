[initial] Initial commit

[safety commit] picking up and dropping crates is working fine; noticed a problem with the random placing of crates -- will look at it later (and also it is only for testing purposes)

[incremental] placed the pipe placeholders; time to implement some managed crate placement (probably directly in the hold) to create stacks, so that I can evaluate them

[incremental] Control deployment of crates through the robot is OK; now to work on some recursive group recognition

[preliminary, incremental] right before I attempt the recursive group count

[incremental] I might actually be able to pull off group assignment without recursion...

[incremental] finally recursive breaking down of groups is working (apparently); meanwhile simple border checks for movement apparently went to hell; to be checked...

[incremental] fixed the out-of-boundry error while moving

[incremental] working on the tile group highlighting

[incremental] grouping color kinda ready (lazy version); found a problem with the recursion - used a queue instead of a stack, so I overflow... *facepalm*

[incremental] reworked the group assignment to use a stack and basically fixed the recursion, as it only appeared to be fine; next: prope group number management and may be some Unity work on the highlighted tiles

[incremental] group assignment has been reworked and is working fine; the highlighting scheme appears to be done - -propper creation of new colors and removing along with associated groups (the hue line on top is a debugging tool)

[incremental] Some visual changes - pipes now are generated on the proper places

[half-step] created crate-type-probability mapping, but something in the initiation of the crates breaks down; will look into it (stopping half way, cause tired)

[incremental] service lane is added; TODO : skip assigning crates from the service lane to the groups; remove highligting of crates in the service lane

[incremental] removed group assignment and highlight assignment for the crates in the service lane

[midcode] building group content indeces

[incremental] group content indices built; should immediately move to the alternative pick-up system, otherwise too much trouble is coming (for no gain)

[rework] almost reworked the ne wcrates spawning - problems with picked crate type and picking positions

[rework] started building the Crate class to perform the Crate/Group/Order (hereafter CGO) conversion
