# Stack-n-Pack
A simple tile arrangement game

The player operates in a grid with limited size. Crates of random type (4 in total) are accessible for pick up at any time. A number of 'orders' are available, each order consisting of a variable number of crates with random distribution of types within them. The player has to use the incoming crates to arrange them within the storage space, trying to match one or more of the orders. Once a group of arranged crates matches an order, the order and the matching crates are removed, freeing space in the storage area and allowing a new order to be generated. Fulfilling orders also generates points.
The points have two purposes - they may count towards the vicroty conditions of the game, but can also be used as a currency. With that currency the player can destroy crates, request an icoming crate to be changed to another type or decline an order and request a new one is generated in it's place.
