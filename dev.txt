[initial] Initial commit

[safety commit] picking up and dropping crates is working fine; noticed a problem with the random placing of crates -- will look at it later (and also it is only for testing purposes)

[incremental] placed the pipe placeholders; time to implement some managed crate placement (probably directly in the hold) to create stacks, so that I can evaluate them

[incremental] Control deployment of crates through the robot is OK; now to work on some recursive group recognition

[preliminary, incremental] right before I attempt the recursive group count

[incremental] I might actually be able to pull off group assignment without recursion...

[incremental] finally recursive breaking down of groups is working (apparently); meanwhile simple border checks for movement apparently went to hell; to be checked...

[incremental] fixed the out-of-boundry error while moving

[incremental] working on the tile group highlighting

[incremental] grouping color kinda ready (lazy version); found a problem with the recursion - used a queue instead of a stack, so I overflow... *facepalm*

[incremental] reworked the group assignment to use a stack and basically fixed the recursion, as it only appeared to be fine; next: prope group number management and may be some Unity work on the highlighted tiles

[incremental] group assignment has been reworked and is working fine; the highlighting scheme appears to be done - -propper creation of new colors and removing along with associated groups (the hue line on top is a debugging tool)

[incremental] Some visual changes - pipes now are generated on the proper places

[half-step] created crate-type-probability mapping, but something in the initiation of the crates breaks down; will look into it (stopping half way, cause tired)

[incremental] service lane is added; TODO : skip assigning crates from the service lane to the groups; remove highligting of crates in the service lane

[incremental] removed group assignment and highlight assignment for the crates in the service lane

[midcode] building group content indeces

[incremental] group content indices built; should immediately move to the alternative pick-up system, otherwise too much trouble is coming (for no gain)

[rework] almost reworked the ne wcrates spawning - problems with picked crate type and picking positions

[rework] started building the Crate class to perform the Crate/Group/Order (hereafter CGO) conversion

[rework, UnderConstruction] halfway through Objectification; no compilation errors, now going through the code to rework a bunh of methods that still don't know things have changed...

[rework, incremental] building the group/group controller classes

[rework, incremental] propagating objectification; broke the group colour assignment and the type that has been handed down from the factories

[rework, incremental] almost fixed factory work; broke some crate type conversion (will fix after headache)

[rework, incremental] off-by-one-on-multiple-levels :)

[rework, incremental] major rebuild finally in progress

[rework, incremental] almost done with the storage space (something is fishy in prefab-land)

[rebuilding, incremental] color functionality is back, bit trying to entangle the classes in-code leads to timing problems within Unity

[rebuilding, incremental] test crate placement fixed; need registration and re-coloring according to content

[rebuilding, incremental] re-introduced player; working on crate pick-up and release

[rebuilding] brought back the player content UI; clamps appear to be working (they can not work, all they can do is appear to work)

[rebuilding, reimplementing] halfway through group highlighting

[rework, rebuild] almost brought group coloring back

[rebuild] TODO : remove group-to-color mapping when removing a group

[intermittent] safety commit; grouping and coloring appear to be fine (see Pitch Black...)

[debuggery] something's not fine with the crate swapping

[incremental] started generating orders (at laaast!); still working on a sample order; TODO - check if the orders should be indexed starting from 0 or from 1

[incremental, rework] restored content loading from fatories; group number proliferation needs fixing

[rework] some wires have crossed; need to rework the recursion, possibly simplify it a little

[incremental] started working on the order visuals; a bit annoying...

[b > incremental]  deconstructing order index and resolving the visuals worked; proof-of-contept only

[b > incremental] working on orders

[b > incremental] orders generate fine' proceed to order-group index comparison

[m > incremental] order management kinda fine; order/group matching still clunky

[m > incremental] something is wrong with re-calculating group content; still debugging

[m > incremental] streamlined some; found a super weird glitch and the door to madness...

[m > incremental] multiple groups matching seems OK, proper action gidits assigned; a rogue bug with duplicate color indices is present (have to checl color release...)

[m > incremental] found the little buggar! order/group matching appears to work fine; could not induce a bug at this point; plus I found that having one order contain another is fun! NOW the last part - clean up finished orders!

[m > incremental] bugaroo again maybe - check picking up a crate with two nbrs of teh same group; TODO : consolidate input with Input.inputString

[m > incremental, bug hunt] a problem with the timing when dispatching' lastly we hit a stone when re-applying highlighting back to the storage
